/- Prove the law of excluded middle without using `by_cases` or lemmas from the library.
You will need to use `by_contra` in the proof. -/

/- ## Converging sequences

In the next few exercises, you prove more lemmas about converging sequences. -/

/-- From the lecture, the sequence `u` of real numbers converges to `l`. -/
def SequentialLimit (u : ℕ → ℝ) (l : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |u n - l| < ε

/- Let's prove that reindexing a convergent sequence
by a reindexing function that tends to infinity
produces a sequence that converges to the same value. -/

/- Let's prove the squeeze theorem for sequences.
You will want to use the lemma in the library that states
`|a| < b ↔ -b < a ∧ a < b`. -/

/- Let's prove that the sequence `n ↦ 1 / (n+1)` converges to `0`.
  It will be useful to know that if `x : ℝ` then `⌈x⌉₊ : ℕ` is `x` rounded up
  (in fact, it's rounded up to 0 if `x ≤ 0`). You will need some lemmas from the library, and `simp`
  will be useful to simplify.
  In the goal you will see `↑n`. This is the number `n : ℕ` interpreted as a real number `↑n : ℝ`.
  To type this number yourself, you have to write `(n : ℝ)`.

  I will prove for you that `n ↦ -1 / (n + 1)` also converges to `0`. -/

lemma exercise3_5 : SequentialLimit (fun n ↦ sin n / (n+1)) 0 := by sorry

/- Now let's prove that if a convergent sequence is nondecreasing, then it must stay below the
limit. -/
def NondecreasingSequence (u : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ n m, n ≤ m → u n ≤ u m

/- As mentioned in exercise 2, `α × β` is the cartesian product of the types `α` and `β`.
Elements of the cartesian product are denoted `(a, b)`, and the projections are `.1` and `.2`.
As an example, here are two ways to state when two elements of the cartesian product are equal. -/

variable {α β γ : Type*}
example (a a' : α) (b b' : β) : (a, b) = (a', b') ↔ a = a' ∧ b = b' := Prod.ext_iff
example (x y : α × β) : x = y ↔ x.1 = y.1 ∧ x.2 = y.2 := Prod.ext_iff

/- Hard exercise: Let's prove that if `f : α → γ` and `g : β → γ` are injective function whose
  ranges partition `γ`, then `Set α × Set β` is in bijective correspondence to `Set γ`.

  To help you along the way, some ways to reformulate the hypothesis are given,
  which might be more useful than the stated hypotheses.
  Remember: you can use `simp [hyp]` to simplify using hypothesis `hyp`. -/
